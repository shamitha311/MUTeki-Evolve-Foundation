"""Host-side control receiver for the reverse-connect Runtime Control Plane.

Topology (see docs/DESIGN_worker_image_clean_rebuild.md §8-9): the in-container
supervisor does NOT listen — it DIALS this receiver. So the host runs ONE long-lived
receiver (a TCP listener bound to MUTEKI_CONTROL_BIND, default 127.0.0.1:9100; the
compose layout sets 0.0.0.0 so sibling worker containers can reach it) that every
run's supervisor connects into. Each supervisor sends a Hello {run_id, token}; we validate
the token against what `ensure_container` registered for that run, then keep the
connection as a `_SupervisorLink` keyed by run_id.

The HOST is still the command side ("reverse-connect, forward-control"): worker
threads call `link.start_worker(...)` / `link.signal(...)` which write op frames on
the link and read back the supervisor's replies/stream — multiplexed over the single
connection by req_id (replies) and worker_id (stream frames).

This module is THREADED (plain sockets + threads), NOT asyncio, because it's driven
from the swarm's synchronous worker threads (CliSolver runs each worker in a thread).
A dedicated accept thread + one reader thread per supervisor connection feed
thread-safe queues the worker threads consume. The receiver is a process-wide
singleton started once (lazily, or from the backend lifespan).

The supervisor is a DUMB executor; this receiver is pure transport + routing. It does
NOT touch flag/fact/graph/key business logic — that stays in the swarm/gate.
